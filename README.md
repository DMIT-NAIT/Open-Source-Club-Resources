# Open Source Club Resources

## Description

This repository is for Open source club members at NAIT so that we can share some information about where to get some more resources on open source.

As well I'd love to share a few wins here so if you do have a pull request in a open source repository please link them and maybe others can learn from the process you've gone through.

Please add your name and a link to your github repo in the Members Section
